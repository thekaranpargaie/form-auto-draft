# Form Auto-Drafting Library

## Introduction

The Form Auto-Drafting Library is a JavaScript library that allows users to automatically save and restore form data in web applications. It is designed to help users in situations where their online forms get refreshed due to network or other issues, preventing them from losing their entered data.

## Features

- Automatic form data saving: The library automatically saves form data at regular intervals, ensuring that users don't lose their progress.
- Form data restoration: Users can easily restore their previously saved form data with a single function call.
- Lightweight and easy to use: The library is built using pure vanilla JavaScript and has no external dependencies. It can be easily integrated into any web application.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To use the Form Auto-Drafting Library, follow these steps:

1. Download the library file or include it in your project from a CDN.
2. Include the library in your HTML file:

```html
<script src="form-auto-drafting-library.js"></script>
```

### Usage

#### Saving Form Data

To enable auto-drafting and save form data, use the `startDraftingForm` function. It takes two parameters: the `formId` and an optional `uniqueIdentifier` (useful when multiple instances of the same form exist).

```javascript
// Start auto-drafting and save form data
startDraftingForm("myForm", "user1");
```

#### Restoring Form Data

To restore previously saved form data, use the `populateFormData` function. It takes the same parameters as `startDraftingForm`: the `formId` and the `uniqueIdentifier`.

```javascript
// Restore form data
populateFormData("myForm", "user1");
```

#### Stopping Auto-Drafting

To stop auto-drafting and prevent further saving of form data, call the `stopDraftingForm` function.

```javascript
// Stop auto-drafting
stopDraftingForm();
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Saving and Restoring Form Data

```html
<form id="myForm">
  <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Name" />
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email" />
  <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" />
  <button type="button" onclick="saveFormData()">Save Data</button>
  <button type="button" onclick="restoreFormData()">Restore Data</button>
</form>

<script src="form-auto-drafting-library.js"></script>
<script>
  // Start auto-drafting and save form data
  startDraftingForm("myForm", "user1");

  function saveFormData() {
    // Perform additional form data saving logic if needed
    alert("Form data saved!");
  }

  function restoreFormData() {
    // Restore form data
    populateFormData("myForm", "user1");
  }
</script>
```

In this example, the form with the ID "myForm" is automatically drafted using the `startDraftingForm` function. The form data can be saved with a custom logic in the `saveFormData` function, and restored using the `populateFormData` function.

### Example 2: Handling Auto-Drafting for Multiple Forms

```html
<form id="form1">
  <!-- Form fields -->
</form>

<form id="form2">
  <!-- Form fields -->
</form>

<script src="form-auto-drafting-library.js"></script>
<script>
  // Start auto-drafting and

 save form data for form1
  startDraftingForm("form1", "user1");

  // Start auto-drafting and save form data for form2
  startDraftingForm("form2", "user2");
</script>
```

In this example, two forms (form1 and form2) are independently auto-drafted using separate unique identifiers (user1 and user2). This allows the library to manage and restore form data for each form separately.

## The End Notes

The Form Auto-Drafting Library provides a simple and effective solution for automatically saving and restoring form data in web applications. By integrating this library into your forms, you can enhance the user experience and prevent data loss due to network or other issues.
